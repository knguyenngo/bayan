## Bayan

This project is inspired by https://corpus.quran.com/

## The Goal

I'm focused on making it much easier to view and explore all the data within the Quran, starting with a clear way to dive into its divisions, vocabulary, and grammar. Beyond just organizing the linguistics, my vision for the project is to eventually build the first app that allows for a side-by-side comparison of different Masahif, making it simple to see the unique variations between different Qira'at and Riwayat.
